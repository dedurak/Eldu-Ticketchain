# Eldu-Ticketchain
Still buidling the project.


## The Project
The goal of the project is to create a new business environment for airlines ticket distribution. Current business processes are too much centralized and not fully automatized. In case of flight cancellations or unexpected delays, customers have the right to get back their payments or a compensation payment from airlines. 
And this is what makes customers angry, they need to apply for a refunding or compensation payment and further are used to wait until the airlines administrators confirm the application. 

Here we'll take advantage of the BSC and use smart contracts, where each of them distinguish in its responsibilities, to create a new exemplary business environment.
